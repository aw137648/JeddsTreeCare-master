  <h2>What is an Emerald Ash borer?</h2>
  <p>Emerald ash borer (EAB), Agrilus planipennis Fairmaire, is an exotic beetle that was discovered in southeastern Michigan near Detroit in the summer of 2002. The adult beetles nibble on ash foliage but cause little damage. The larvae (the immature stage) feed on the inner bark of ash trees, disrupting the tree's ability to transport water and nutrients. Emerald ash borer probably arrived in the United States on solid wood packing material carried in cargo ships or airplanes originating in its native Asia. As of October 2018, it is now found in 35 states, and the Canadian provinces of Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and Manitoba.</p>

  <h2>How does it kill a tree?</h2>
  <p>Adult beetles lay eggs on the bark of ash trees. When the eggs hatch, the larvae (immature beetles) bore into the bark and feed on the transportation tissues of the tree. This disrupts the movement of nutrients and water within the tree, girdling it and causing tree death.</p>

  <h2>What trees are affected?</h2>
  <p>Emerald ash borer attacks all species of ash native to the United States as well as native white fringetree. The four species of ash native to North Carolina include white ash, green ash, Carolina ash, and pumpkin ash. Both healthy and unhealthy trees can be attacked. In 2014, EAB specimens were found infesting white fringetree (aka Old Manâ€™s Beard) in Ohio.  Subsequent surveys indicated this was a widespread phenomenon.  Mountain ash, which is not considered a true ash, is not susceptible to EAB.</p>
